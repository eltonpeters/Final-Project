## Project Overview

The Dice Game is a simple web-based game where the player competes against the computer in a dice-rolling competition over three rounds. The player with the highest total score at the end of the three rounds wins.

## Game Rules

1. There will be three rounds.
2. In each round, you and the computer will face off by rolling two dice each.
3. Scoring for each round is determined as follows:
   - If either of your dice rolls a 1, your score for that round is 0.
   - If you roll two of the same number (except 1), your score for that round is twice the sum of the dice values.
   - Otherwise, your score for that round is the sum of the two dice values.
4. After three rounds, the player with the highest total score wins!
